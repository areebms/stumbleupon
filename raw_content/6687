<p>The blueberry season has just arrived where I live, and I&#8217;ve been happily working my way through my list of favorite uses for this wonderfully flavorful, vitamin-rich native American fruit. I&#8217;ve been eating fresh blueberries with cereal for breakfast, having them in liquid form as smoothies for lunch, and serving them with yogurt as an afternoon pick-me-up.</p>
<p>In this buttermilk cake recipe, however, I chose to get &#8220;my thrill on Blueberry Hill&#8221; by combining blueberries with ingredients that complement their flavor so very well: American Neufchatel cheese (a less rich form of cream cheese), lemons, and almonds. In other words, I aimed for the composition and taste of a blueberry cheese Danish pastry, but in cake form. This is a lovely, simple, and moist cake that would work equally well with other brightly flavored soft fruits, such as cherries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, bilberries, or apricots. <span id="more-3989"></span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: normal;">ingredients</span></h4>
<p><em>The cake:</em><br />
1 1/2 cup unbleached flour<br />
2  teaspoons double acting baking powder<br />
1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
A pinch of nutmeg<br />
1/2 cup butter, at room temperature<br />
1 cup light brown sugar<br />
2 eggs<br />
2/3 cup buttermilk or plain yogurt<br />
2 teaspoons lemon juice<br />
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p><em>The topping:</em><br />
8 ounces American Neufchatel cheese, or cream cheese<br />
1/2 cup sugar<br />
1 teaspoon unbleached flour<br />
1 egg<br />
2 teaspoons lemon zest<br />
2 cups fresh or fresh frozen blueberries<br />
1/2 cup sliced almonds</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: normal;">preparation</span></h4>
<p><img src="http://moderncomfortfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Blueberry-Cheese-Danish-Cake-Insert1.jpg" alt="" /><img src="http://moderncomfortfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Blueberry-Cheese-Danish-Cake-Insert2.jpg" alt="" /><img src="http://moderncomfortfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Blueberry-Cheese-Danish-Cake-Insert3.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Oil a 9-inch round cake or spring form pan and lightly dust it with flour.</li>
<li>Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. Set aside.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter until creamy. Gradually add 1 cup light brown sugar and beat for approximately one minute until light and well blended. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating for approximately two minutes after each addition. Alternately, add one-half of the flour mixture and one-half of the yogurt, beating briefly on low after each addition. Repeat. Stir in the lemon juice and vanilla extract. Pour the cake batter into the prepared baking pan.</li>
<li>In a mixing bowl, beat together the Neufchatel (or cream) cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon flour, 1 egg, and the lemon zest for approximately two minutes until very smooth and creamy. Spoon this cheese mixture over the cake batter and spread, leaving a one-inch margin of cake batter exposed around the perimeter of the cake, as shown in the photo above. Sprinkle the blueberries over the Neufchatel cheese mixture and the sliced almonds around the perimeter of the cake, as shown in the photo above.</li>
<li>Bake for 40-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool the cake to room temperature and serve.</li>
</ol>
<p class="note"><strong>notes:</strong><br />
If you prefer a sweeter cake, an optional glaze may be applied to this cake after removing it from the oven. Whisk together 1 tablespoon lemon juice with 1/2 cup confectioner&#8217;s sugar and drizzle the mixture over the top of the cake.</p>

<p>The cake looks fabulous and I made it but I substituted 2 tablespoons of lemon juice for lemon zest.  I got that conversion off the internet.  However the cake was not cooked in the center.  I continued to cook it for 75 mins and I realize now it must have been because of this.   What can I substitute or lemon zest if I don&#8217;t have any.  Thank you for all the great recipes!</p>

<p>Oh so sorry!  By adding the extra liquid of the extra lemon juice, the batter would have been both wetter and taller, both of which would have added to the baking time. Next time, it might be best if you just leave out the lemon zest (grated fresh lemon peel) or, instead, add just a couple of drops of lemon extract as a substitute. Other possible issues? Was your baking pan smaller than 9 inches (about 23 centimeters)?  That would also have made the baking period longer.  The size and color of the baking pan used can have a big impact on cake baking time, as can slight differences in the oven temperature. Again, so sorry you had trouble!</p>

<p>Barbara, if I were to go for it and enjoy a sweet treat, I would look no further than this creamy blueberry cheesecake.  It is beautiful to look at and filled with ingredients I love: blueberries, cream cheese and almonds. This would be great for summer entertaining! xo</p>

<p>Just wanted to say that I made this the other night and it was ABSOLUTELY delicious! It took much longer than 40 minutes to bake, though, but I think this was probably because I used frozen blueberries and didn&#8217;t thaw them out properly before adding them&#8230; anyway, thanks for the recipe. Everyone who tasted it is eager to have it again!</p>

<p>Many thanks for you kind comments and also your helpful feedback. I used a dark colored, 9-inch springform pan for this cake, and it was done (in fact, slightly overdone) in 40 minute. However, I have noticed myself, when following recipes, that even slight differences in pan size, color, or oven temperature can have a significant impact on the baking time required. Based on your feedback, I have edited the above to include a baking time range.</p>

<p>I must admit that I did have a small slice of this for breakfast the day after making it, and it went down pretty well. My personal preference is for unfrosted cakes, this one is not excessively sweet, and it would work well as a coffee cake also.</p>

<p>Frozen blueberries, thawed and drained, should work just fine. Based on my sense of this newly developed recipe, it would also work well with other soft fruits such as strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, cranberries (with more sugar added), apricots, perhaps peaches, or a mixture of these sweet/tart fruits.</p>

<p>WOW that looks divine&#8230;I have to try it and SOON!<br />
I was wondering, I&#8217;m from Malta and we don&#8217;t get buttermilk here, would any plain yogurt do the trick?<br />
Also, would regular baking powder work as well as the double acting type?<br />
Thanks for the inspiration!</p>

<p>Beautiful cake. Love the combination of the flavors of blueberry and lemon with buttermilk in the batter. I planted blueberries last year and they are in full bloom right now. I&#8217;ll file this one away and make it when the blueberries are ripe a little later this year!</p>

<p>This looks really lovely Barbara. Blueberries are my favourite fruit and I love including them in desserts. I have not heard of neufchatel cheese so don&#8217;t know whether you can get it in England but will try it with normal cream cheese.</p>

<p>Normal cream cheese would work just fine and be more scrumptious. Cheese terminology is a bit complicated, at least here in the US. Real Neufchatel cheese is of ancient French origins. American-style &#8220;cream cheese&#8221; (as in Kraft Philadelphia brand) resulted from a failed attempt to make it in the 1800s. And American &#8220;Neufchatel&#8221; cheese is now simply the longstanding (and essentially incorrect) name for &#8220;cream&#8221; cheese made with a lower level of butterfat in it.  Don&#8217;t ask me why.</p>
