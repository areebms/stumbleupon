    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: August 6, 2007

Marijuana Dealers Offer Schwarzenegger One Billion Dollars

August 6 -- A coalition of California marijuana growers and dealers has offered Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger one billion dollars to solve the current state budget crisis. The group, calling itself Let Us Pay Taxes makes the offer through its web site LetUsPayTaxes.com. The offer comes at a time when the California legislature is deadlocked on a new budget and California has stopped issuing checks for vitally needed social services. Legislators are currently arguing over which programs will be cut in order to balance the budget.

“It is ridiculous that California can’t pay its bills,” said spokesman Clifford Schaffer. “It is a tragedy that they will cut badly needed services and programs such as medical care for the elderly and prison drug treatment when the money to fund all these programs and more is there and available. Everyone who is currently waiting for a check from the state should be enraged at this foolishness.”

Regulation and taxation of marijuana could produce six billion dollars in additional tax revenue, according to economic studies linked from their web site LetUsPayTaxes.com. In addition, it could save up to ten billion dollars in enforcement costs. “That is a conservative estimate,” said Schaffer. “By other estimates, the revenues could be five times that. The economists are with us all the way on this one. Marijuana prohibition is an economic disaster.”

“Let’s face reality,” Schaffer says. “Marijuana legalization is inevitable. The situation is already beyond control in California. The state and local authorities have offered safe harbor for medical marijuana use and the Federal Government simply doesn’t have the resources for effective control.” More importantly, says Schaffer, the operators of the medical marijuana clubs are no longer afraid of the Federal Government. “If you talk to them, you will find that they know they are going to win this battle. They know that the DEA is vastly outnumbered and can’t begin to prosecute all of them. The few that are prosecuted are accepting their fate as martyrs because they know that what they are doing is right. They are willing to sacrifice themselves to make the point that the Federal Government has just gone too far in interfering with very personal and private decisions. There is no way the DEA is going to win this battle. At this point, it is all over but the counting of the money – and the victims of the DEA.”

Schaffer went on to say that the national market for marijuana has been estimated from a low of ten billion dollars per year to more than fifty billion dollars per year. “The first states to regulate and tax marijuana will receive an economic bonanza bigger than the original California Gold Rush,” says Schaffer. “Some states will get rich like the Saudis.” Schaffer predicts that it will not take long for some local areas to wake up to the economic possibilities. “We are talking potentially big bucks here,” he said. “The Canadians are already starting to take note of a cannabis-fueled economic boom in some areas. Politicians can’t resist fresh cash, especially when it is coming to their local community. There will be big winners and losers here. The winners will be the ones who recognize the foregone conclusion first.”

The group also cites foreign terrorism as a reason to regulate and tax marijuana. “Drug Czar John Walters is being dishonest when he says that marijuana money goes to criminals and terrorists. The only reason any of that money goes to criminals or terrorists is because of the prohibition that Walters supports,” said Schaffer. “Marijuana prohibition makes criminals rich just like alcohol prohibition did. The criminals are now so rich and powerful that they can challenge the legitimate governments of their own countries. There is no reason to send billions of dollars per year to foreign criminal gangs when patriotic Americans make the best products in the world. There is no reason to suffer such a huge foreign trade deficit when that money could be providing jobs and funding badly needed services right here in the USA.”

Let Us Pay Taxes calls upon all US citizens to sign their petition at their web site <a href="http://LetUsPayTaxes.com" title="http://LetUsPayTaxes.com">http://LetUsPayTaxes.com</a> and press the issue with their lawmakers. “Take the money, please,” said Schaffer. “These people want to contribute. Now it is up to our politicians to tell us why they want to send those billions to foreign criminal gangs rather than to their own voters.”<div class="field field-type-location field-field-location">

    <p>sicntired@mac.com,Vancouver,B.C.Canada  There are still people who think that smokers are junkies.Some think the war is making a profit.Many just don't have a clue but have a lot to say anyway.The economics,health issues and all evidence of scientific study say that pot should be legal and regulated.Common sense is on the legalisation side.It's just a matter of time and it starts with getting the truth out there.One day there won't be so many misguided comments on articles like this one.</p>      </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p>It is sad that people dont realize that WE...PEOPLE...HUMAN-BEINGS, are the ones who screw-up, we make stupid mistakes all of the time, even without being high or drunk!   We want to blame the products we have made or grown or created...instead of taking responsibility for the use of the product!  </p>
<p>A child brings a gun into school and kills another child...we automatically blame the gun and try to ban ALL guns!  It's like we are trying to blame just the gun for the whole insident... arrest the gun and put it in jail!   Just ban all guns and forget what happened and everything will be ok, right? We know better yet it ALWAYS gose back to that instead of the obvious,  " Where did the gun came from...let's say the parents, ok...?"  Dad gose out and buys the gun.  Well dad needs to be RESPONSIBLE and be held ACCOUNTABLE for his child and the childs actions and where your gun is at all times.</p>
<p>  The same scenario works with drugs...we as individuals...as a society, NEED to start being grown-ups and hold ourselves responsible for our actions!  Legalizing Drugs...whether it is Marajuana, cocaine, heroin, all comes down to those two words again... RESPONSIBILITY and ACCOUNTABILITY!  These are all medicine anyways.  We outlaw these drugs but then make the same things in pill form in pharmacology and call the different names but as long as the drug/medicine works, thats all that matters!  Example: Heroin=morphine=oxycodone.  Cocaine=dexatrine.... and plenty more! </p>
<p> Marajuana is a wonderful drug for depression, also a good drug for creativity...the same gose for shrooms!  Coca leaves...cocaine, was used to make laborers work harder and faster...basically helps with a variety of things, give you energy of course but also helps with pain!  Heroin, opium; the best pain killer we have!  Herion is an opioid and is very strong and can be very addictive.  But opioids are needed to relieve suffering and Heroin's most basic chemical structure is in FACT exactly the same chemical make-up of "our bodies natural pain-killers" Endorphins!  So for all the "Moral Crusaders" out there..."How pure do you really think you are?"</p>
<p>All we are doing by continuing the "prohibition" is taking huge sums of money and throwing it away.  As of right now it is very hard to say what the furure holds.  The War on Drugs employes SO many people I dont think the government will easily give it up.  Also, the public (for the most part) is still unaware that the drug-war has forced it's way into the doctors office and created a "Pain Crisis in America," with an estimated 76 million people living with pain and legitimate innocent pain management doctors being arrested at gun-point being forced out of their offices while their patients are left to suffer in agony!  </p>
<p>The truth is I know all too well what it is like to suffer because of a War on drugs!  I live with pain everyday because of a Degenerative Disc Disease that has herniated 8 discs from my Cervical, Thorasic and Lumbar spine.  I have watch as the DEA took my doctor away...I have seen what they call "Justice".  I have had my life destroyed by the Drug-War!  Every doctor I have ever had was too afraid to prescribe the needed medication for fear of the DEA.</p>
<p>Believe me when I tell you that there is NO rational explaination for the ignorance of the citizens of this country, so deathly afraid of addiction and all the horrors of drugs!  People dont realize that by prohibiting drugs THEY create a Black-market and a whole system of coruption!  The DEA cant go after the drug lords because the drug lords pay the countries government off...then pay the DEA off...it fills too many pockets to stop and no one has to lift a finger to do anything!  The DEA has to make it look likt they are working so the bust one tracker-trailer full of drugs, but let the other hundreds of trucks go by..."Dont you see?"  The DEA is attacking Doctors who treat the disabled, sick and the elderly...while the media helps them lie to the public and people get inraged about that "Horrible Oxycontin"!  FOOLS!</p>
<p>It was said in another post...(If this country was really FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, we would already be rich off the drug money not the pharmacutical manufacturer's!)  Drug's would be pure and safer!   Pain patients like myself wouldn't have to fly across the country to find a doctor, go out to the streets to find pain killers or comitt suicide because of the horrible pain.   Kids wouldn't be using high school as drug dens!  If the DEA really wanted to bust drug dealers they would just raid a local-high school for crying-out-loud!</p>
<p> So really whats left to say? We have plenty of options...we allways have!  We just choose the wrong ones.  We live in a time where things could go either way.  We are on the edge, (so to speak) and we can just fall to the bottom or wake-up our minds and fly off into a "New day" for humanity...a new age of enlightenment, perhaps?    HAHA....we will fall....we just can free our minds from the stupidity of the everyday nonsense that consumes us.  ugh, I need a drink.</p>      </div>

    <p>pot ain't bad for you except for the generall smoke inhalation risks, just like with how tabacco used to be: before they added the addictives and the chemicles. i've smoked pot for 3 years and the only violent act i commited was against myself, and that was because i accidently burned my hand with my lighter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! there is only one reason and one reason only that pot isn't leagal. it's not because of the conservative christian bullshit, or it being a gateway drug, or any of the other reasons that the gov. and other groups want you to believe. it's the fact that the goverment hasn't figured out a succsessfull way to regulat, tax and sell it yet. they are still afraid that they won't control it completely. they need to wake up and realize that they don't even control tobacco or achohol fully yet, but that they still make billions off of it. legalize pot and you'd see a country on the rise again. we'd have less poverty in this country and more money twards public benifits.</p>

    <p>This is BAD!! All this hype about legalization is the wrong road!!  You see, when weed is legalized it is taxed and regulated.  This will kill the spirit and the potency of marijuana. We've already seen it occur in 'medical marijuana', the crappiest, weakest weed ever known to man.<br />
Legalization will destroy the weed culture.  It will just become another packaged, overexpensive, shit-quality government run revenue program.</p>
<p>There are good points for the decriminalization of weed, such as<br />
'They spend so much money trying to enforce it when they should be focusing on the real problems like cystal meth and cocaine. It's rather stupid that someone can have a criminal record simply because they got caught smoking a joint by an overzealous policeman...'</p>
<p>To this I say that I agree that money and energy should be spent elsewhere, and that perhaps marijuana should be decriminalized, but never 'legalized' and privatized, and *owned*<br />
(where decriminalizing it is making it 'not wrong', almost unofficially, where it will not be persued and prosecuted, but it is not officially condoned or supported, and legalizing is saying yay its ok and subsequently the government takes control of it like they did cigarettes and alcohol)</p>      </div>

    <p>I heard a little while ago 2 people on medical pills because the hottness of the heat were killed because the mix of hot weather and pills... Why is medical pills what kill people legal and pot isn't... I've come to a conclusion the goverment wants to band the innocent plant! So people do go to hard drugs, so people do be miserable, so people hate each other. Cause we all know if you smoke enough you wont stop smiling... Well I've heard long time ago they used it to help mentally unstable people. So that leads to believe banding pot only makes sane people become metally unstable people! Futher more, drugs kill brain cells and marijuana does too but marijuana brain cells regrow over time... I think its a shame that people look so iggnorant for looking at an innocent plant what you can grow in your own backyard, what blends in next to the tomato tree and say its not the right thing to do...</p>      </div>

    <p>Some people commenting here would rather pot stay illegal than have the elderly being care for, or all of the other social assitance programs.</p>
<p>This is absolutely discussting and distasteful to see people being so old fashioned and pig headed, cannabis should be legalized.</p>
<p>Even if you don't agree with the legalization, how can you agree with the distreatment of so many people.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, as a proud Canadian citizen, I'm retiring to California in two years, mainly for the beautiful weather. I plan on growing cannabis organically weather it's legal or not, it will be legalized eventually though, hopefully by the time I move down there.</p>      </div>

If every person in the usa that wants to have the marijuana  to be taxed and legal write a lettle to the groverment and to the new media and tell them you want this they would start to listen.If they do nothing tell them do this or I will not pay any more income taxes.just think if everbody did this {the groverment would go broke in one month}The drug companys the insurance companysThe oil companys are all in this together,The drug companys dont want it legal ia would cut there profit,The oil companys are lying to us,last month gas drop by 10 to 15 cent a gallon whyll the cost of a barrel of oil rised by $12.00 a barrel.Why we had refined more than we could store.The insurance companys blaming the groverment for a bad job after all the hurricans and fires and disaster relief that was screw up.Just so they dont have to pay the money out to us.But each and every one of them are there with there hand out wanting more money from us.Just think if they would get sick and marijuana would cure them you bet they would have the cure. NOW EVERY ONE WRITE THERE GROVER THERE CONGRESS MEN THERE SENATORS AND TELL THEM THAT YOU WANT MARIJUANA LEGALZIES. PEACE</p>      </div>

    <p>1) The reason hemp was labelled marijuana and outlawed, more-or-less, worldwide since the thirties.<br />
2) The subversive nature of the herb.<br />
3) The damage it would do to pharmaceutical companies profits, for not only high priced and much needed medicines, but also the minor everyday consumer ones.<br />
4) The damage it would do to the taxable alcohol market profits.<br />
5) The damage it would inflict on the hard-drug market.</p>

For those who would consider themselves against the intoxicating nature of the herb, but regard themselves as intelligent, should research the facts of the environmental benefits of using hemp, and maybe... why it was suppressed.</p>      </div>

    <p>I agree wholeheartedly.  Everyone who ever does anything illegal ever should definitely be forced to wear a bright orange impossible-to-remove dog collar around their neck, as this is clearly the most logical and economically efficient solution to all the world's crime problems.  Maybe then Satan will make them be happy again and they won't kill themselves and children.  It will be glorious.</p>      </div>

    <p>You know, ive read every post on here i hear about how much money the goverment spends on law enforcement, i hear about how much money weed would make if it were legalized. All this information is on the internet, but will you ever see it on the desk of our president? maybe our governer or in some small court system, its made it to the big times a few times and each time they always think of a reason it should be illegal.NOWS THE TIME !!! Most of you are even scared to go get busted with pot, me on the other hand have been arrested 23 times for possesion of marijuana 18 of them were more than an ounce, which is a felony in the state of Mississippi. Thats right I have more than 6 cases pending right now waiting on judgement day. I am more than happy to go inside this court room and take whatever punishment they throw at me, because after I receieve it, i will turn around and tell the judge how much of a arrogent bastard he is,and what a waste of money it will be to place me in jail over me having a few ounces of pot in my house. Now 6 cases, which means im sure I will be serveing more than a year behind bars and they will be spending over 20,000 dollars a year to house me in thier facility. Thats more than some people make working in a drug free enviroment. I can always use some help in fighting my cases. The more help I have the louder I will be heard. You can message me through my myspace which is <a href="http://www.myspace.com/kronic" title="http://www.myspace.com/kronic">http://www.myspace.com/kronic</a> donations would be greatly appreciated, and would not return unpaid. Every helping hand will be rewarded in the end believe me. Ive been through this and know the steps...lets get it going guys we are potheads ! and we should be proud of being a pothead, dont hold your head down, hold it up high cos you are high ! Jesus was even high most the time regardless of what the bible tells you. God has given us every seed bearing plant to use !!!! So much money could be saved all we gotta do is get our voices out there to be heard message me on my myspace if you want to help ;) thanks guys and gals</p>

    <p>This is the most insane pap I have seen in a month of Sundays. I don't smoke or drink. That's my own choice, but it works out best for me. perhaps not you or anyone else here, but for me it's the best.</p>
<p>That said, MJ prohibition is a big business. DEA: Billions of dollars in tax money. Companies that sell the DEA all their whiz-bang toys for "drug detection": billions of tax dollars. Prisons to house smokers, both public and private: Billions of tax dollars. The costs of those people once they are out of jail and need to be re-integrated into "proper society", while they are still legal and employment pariahs: billions of tax dollars. And don't even try to get me started on the billions wasted because the chronically ill cannot use MJ in a clinically efficacious setting and manner.</p>
<p>It's idiocy on the grandest scale ever seen.</p>
<p>And the part about China? For the life of me, I have no idea what you are on about and, I suspect, neither do you. It's just some crap you made up in your head or you are trying to create an equivalency<br />
between smoking MJ and the use of opoids. If that is what you are attempting to do, please, go back down to Mom's basement and lock the door behind you. You are not fit or intellectually qualified to interact in polite society.</p>      </div>

    <p>It'd basically be the smart thing to repeal these outdated MJ laws. Which is why it won't occur anytime soon. It'll probably occur once the states reach the economic breaking point and are all out of other options (however scary THOSE may be, i.e cutting social programs for the needy). </p>
<p>Fact is were it legal, taxed and regulated you'd only get positive outcomes. The prisons will be freed of non-violent MJ offenders. Which eases the crowding situation and leaves room for serious violent offenders.<br />
The police forces can divert funds used currently to catch MJ offenders to focus on murders, robberies, rapes and other serious crimes.</p>
<p>A big plus is that it makes it harder for kids to access. I've heard claims of legalizing would make it easier for kids to get. Wrong, this is not the case. Were it legal you'd have to be 21 to buy (just like alcohol) and you'd have to be carded. Call me crazy, but dealers on the street don't check things like I.D's before selling.</p>
<p>So there can only be positive things from this change. But the tobacco, pharmeacutical, alcohol and prison industries are all paying big bucks to make sure this never happens. Only because of fears it'll cut into their profits. Ridiculous. </p>
<p>This will help out the country as a whole and would be the right thing to do. Write to your legislatures and let them know they WILL NOT have future votes from you if they continue to support this failed drug "war" and the corporate interests who still support it!</p>      </div>

    <p>BTW, it's not the government who makes revenue on Income Tax, it's the bankers who lend the government that money.  Let's not forget who's in charge here...  American workers work 4 months of every year or one day per week to line the pockets of greedy bankers in charge of the non-Federal "Federal Reserve".  This is money that goes to pay the INTEREST on the DEFICIT (which if you don't know is actually money borrowed by the govt from the Federal Reserve, you and I pay interest on that in the form of Income Tax.). Bigtime bankers are the guys who felt the sting of the lack of Income Tax revenue during the Great Depression and they'll feel it again during the next one.  If THEY decide they want the money from repealing MJ prohibition like they did with alcohol, it will happen.  But as an astute poster commented above, it breaks down the MK Ultra barriers and there's no worse threat to a fascist regime than the removal of the barriers of brainwashing.</p>      </div>

    <p>Do you know why Prohibition ended?  It is not because the populace wanted to consume liquor and repealed the 18th Amendment.  It is because the government lost so much revenue from the Income Tax during the depression that the only way to fill the government's coffers was to repeal prohibition and tax liquor.  My prediction is that Marijuana prohibition will end the same way.  Bring on that economic collapse baby.</p>      </div>
