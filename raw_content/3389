<p><a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-norwegian-potato-lefse-recipes-from-the-kitchn-175433"><img alt="2012-08-13-Lefse-4.jpg" src="http://i-cdn.apartmenttherapy.com/uimages/kitchen/2012-08-13-Lefse-4.jpg" width="540" height="540" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>Some food lovers collect spices, others collect vintage cake stands. I collect recipes for flatbreads. I love them. Can't get enough. Lefse, in particular, is a flatbread I've been eyeing for some time now. You might even say it's my birthright.</p>
<p><img alt="2012-08-13-Lefse-5.jpg" src="http://i-cdn.apartmenttherapy.com/uimages/kitchen/2012-08-13-Lefse-5.jpg" width="540" height="540" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" />I grew up in Minnesota with my Christensen relatives and Lutsens, Knudsens, and Olsens for neighbors: all of us descended from Scandinavian settlers to the area. And though I heard plenty of stories about lefse, lutefisk, and all the other traditional foods of my forebears, by the time I came on the scene, we were more likely to have <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/weeknight-recipe-easy-homemade-82588">mac and cheese</a> on our table.</p>

<p>But my interest in my culinary heritage has been growing over the past few years, helped along in no small part by a growing global interest in <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/noma-by-ren-redzepi-book-revie-137803">Nordic cuisine</a>. Every church and community cookbook I've inherited has scores of these "Old World" recipes, and without fail, several of them are for lefse.</p>

<p><img alt="2012-08-13-Lefse-3.jpg" src="http://i-cdn.apartmenttherapy.com/uimages/kitchen/2012-08-13-Lefse-3.jpg" width="540" height="540" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" />Lefse is a humble sort of flatbread, made as it is from leftover mashed potatoes. Work in a little flour, roll it out flat, and cook it on the stovetop for dinner! This makes a thin and soft flatbread that's more substantial than a cr&ecirc;pe but more delicate and chewy than a flour tortilla.</p>

<p>The most quintessential way to eat lefse is to spread it with sweet butter, sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar, and then roll it up. This is makes an afternoon snack of surpassing quality. You can also spread them with jam and peanut butter, cream cheese, or nutella, or you can go the savory route and wrap up a few slices of deli meat with cheese.</p>

<p>Lefse? Check! Getting in touch with my roots couldn't be tastier.</p>

<div id="recipe">

<h3>Norwegian Potato Lefse</h3><em>Makes 16 small flatbreads or 8 large flatbreads</em>

<p><em>You can substitute two cups of leftover mashed potatoes for the mashed potatoes in this recipe.</em></p>

<p>1 pound <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/potato-varieties-64061">starchy or all-purpose</a> potatoes<br/>1/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature<br/>1/4 cup heavy cream<br/>1/2 teaspoon of salt, plus more to taste<br/>1 - 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br/>For serving: butter, cinnamon-sugar, jam, peanut butter, cream cheese, cold cuts, cheese slices, gravlax, or any other topping your inner Norwegian desires</p>

<p>Peel the potatoes and cut them into large, uniformly-shaped chunks. Place in a small saucepan and cover with cold water. Over medium-high heat, bring the water and the potatoes to a gentle boil. Cook until the potatoes are very soft and easily pierced with a fork, 10-12 minutes from the start of the boil. Drain the potatoes and transfer to a mixing bowl.</p>

<p>Using a potato masher, potato ricer, or a dinner fork, mash the potatoes as thoroughly as possible; you don't want any lumps. Cut the butter into small chunks and mix it with the potatoes. Add the cream and salt. Keep mixing until the butter and cream are completely absorbed. Taste and add more salt if desired.</p>

<p>Transfer the potatoes to a storage container and refrigerate overnight or up to three days.</p>

<p>When ready to make the lefse, clear a large workspace for dividing and rolling out the flatbreads. Lefse are traditionally made with grooved wooden rolling pins, but a standard rolling pin will do the job just fine. A pastry scraper or sturdy spatula for lifting and transferring the rolled-out flatbreads is also handy.</p>

<p>Mix the mashed potatoes with 1 cup of the flour. At first this will be very crumbly and floury, but the mixture will gradually start coming together. Turn the dough out on the counter and knead once or twice to bring it together into a smooth ball. Roll it into a thick log and then divide it into 16 equal portions for small 6-8" lefse or 8 equal portions for large 10-12" lefse.</p>

<p>Roll each portion of dough between your palms to form a small ball. Cover all the balls with a clean dishtowel off to one side of your workspace.</p>

<p>Set a cast iron skillet or flat grill pan over medium-high heat. When a bead of water sizzles when flicked on the pan, it's ready.</p>

<p>Dust your workspace and rolling pin lightly with flour. Roll one of the rounds of dough in the flour and then press it into a thick disk with the heel of your hand. Working from the center out, roll the dough into as thin a circle as you can manage. Lift, move, and flip the dough frequently as you work to make sure it's not sticking. Use more flour as needed.</p>

<p>Roll the lefse gently onto the rolling pin, as if you were <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/two-ways-to-transfer-pie-dough-65895">transferring pie dough</a>, and lay it in the skillet. Cook for 1-2 minutes on each side until speckled with golden-brown spots. Transfer the cooked lefse to a plate and cover with another clean dish towel.</p>

<p>While one lefse is cooking, roll out the next one. Keep all the cooked lefse under the towel to keep them warm and prevent them from drying out. If the lefse start to stick to the pan, melt a small pat of butter in the pan and wipe it away with a paper towel to leave only a very thin coating of fat on the pan.</p>

<p>Spread the lefse with your topping of choice and roll it up to eat. Leftover lefse can stacked with wax paper between the layers to prevent sticking and kept refrigerated for up to a week or frozen for three months. They can be eaten cold from the fridge or warmed for a few seconds in the microwave.</div></p>

      <p class="text">Do you think these can be made gluten free by substituting rice flour or a flour blend with xanthan gum in it? I wonder how much the gluten is necessary to the structure and form, since there isn't much kneading? Thanks!</p>

Divide into four (yogurt) containers and chill in refrigerator overnight.<br>Preheat lefse griddle to 400 degrees.<br>Remove only one container of your potato mixture at a time from the refrigerator. Add enough flour to your potato mixture so it is no longer sticky (use 1 cup per container as a guide, you may need less-but probably will need more). Form into 1 1/2 oz. balls. You want to keep this mixture as cold as possible so it will require less flour, roll out easier, and not rip as easily.<br>Check again to make sure mixture isn't too sticky (if it is, add more flour) then roll into thin 12" rounds on a floured pastry cloth with a rolling pin and sleeve (also floured). Regularly re-flour the pastry cloth and the rolling pin so the lefse does not stick.<br>Loosen the sheet of lefse from the pastry cloth by sliding the lefse turning stick underneath the entire sheet. When loose, slide the lefse stick under the lefse again and use it to transfer to the hot griddle. Lay half the sheet on the griddle and use the stick to roll the other half onto the griddle. Cook until the lefse starts to bubble up and get light brown spots, then flip. When the second side is done, remove from the griddle and stack between two towels. <br>Bush the griddle quickly with a towel between every sheet, or the excess flour will begin to burn.<br>Allow to cool completely between the towels, then store however you like (we store in a 2 1/2 gallon ziplock-in the fridge if we do not expect to finish within a few days or it can be left out if you are going to finish sooner).<br><br>Yield is approx 40 12" sheets of lefse.</p>

      <p class="text">Thank you! I'm a transplant to Minnesota (hence the screen name) and have had several versions of lefse here, from those lucky enough to have their Norwegian ancestors hand the recipe down. But I've never had the recipe.<br><br>How does it freeze? I have found that leftover lefse just is not the same, even heated up, the day after. It's kinda dry and, well, fridge-y.</p>

      <p class="text">As a über Scandinavian (half Swedish and half Norwegian) I must mention that the lefse is the perfect hot dog bread. This is how you get your wiener served in Norway, just add mustard and ketchup (and maybe some dried onions). And also, as some of you mentioned: butter, sugar and cinnamon makes the perfect treat to a cup of coffee. Enjoy!</p>

      <p class="text">The potato lefse is usually rolled as they break too easily. Other forms of lefse is folded, like Vestlandslefsa, and then there is tykklefse, which is two rounds of lefse stacked with butter, sugar and cinnamon, and then sliced like any other cake. <br>But yes, I grew up in Oslo eating potato lefse as a wrap for my hot dogs...

      <p class="text">Lefse is a must have here in Minnesota, especially around the Christmas/winter season.  I grew up serving a lutefisk dinner at our local Lutheran church and although I don't like lutefisk, the smell always brings back wonderful memories.  My family started making lefse a couple of years ago.  It's quite a lot of work but so worth it.  We plan on taking classes this fall or winter at an adorable shop called Lefse Time which is just across the MN border in Fountain City, WI. They also sell all the accoutrements needed for making lefse.  <a href="http://www.lefsetime.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lefsetime.com/</a></p>
