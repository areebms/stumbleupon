    <div class="ifacts"> <b id="stif">Interesting facts. Did you know?..</b> 
      <ul>
        <li>Persons with a history of suicide attempt do not eat enough  of 
          polyunsaturated fat and fiber<span id="ref"><a href="#ref8">[8]</a></span></li>
        <li>Children often develop tolerance to cow's milk, egg, wheat by school 
          age, whereas allergies to nuts, fish and seafood are generally not outgrown 
          no matter at what age they develop<span id="ref"><a href="#ref14">[14]</a></span></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>When you feel like eating something and think of food, what comes to mind first? Probably it's the taste, odor or color. Those 
      who have to look after their weight will think of the portion size, many 
      think of things like energy, fats, sugars, vitamins or minerals.</p>
    <p>But do you know that the food we eat may cause side effects - something that is usually attributed to drugs and medicines?  And we 
      are not talking about spoiled or poor  quality food. Freshly harvested or 
      just cooked food may also cause side effects, some are serious, some are 
      just disturbing, and some may put you into embarrassing situation.</p>
    <p>However, it doesn't mean that you should avoid the food represented on 
      this list at all costs. These foods <b>may</b> cause side effects. Most 
       effects do not occur in everyone and they occur not every time you 
      eat such food. And besides that, the significance of most foods (especially 
      fruits, vegetables and even chocolate) outweighs the possible side effects 
      they may cause.</p>
    <p>Here is a list of side effects that may be caused by the food.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">1</span> <b class="sest">Allergies</b></p>
    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/side-effects/img/se01.jpg" width="240" height="194"></div>
    <p>In theory, any food can cause an allergy. But in fact just a handful 
      of them  are to blame for 90% of allergic reactions<span id="ref"><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></span>. 
      Most people with food allergies are allergic to fewer than 4 foods. The 
      foods most commonly causing allergic reactions are<span id="ref"><a href="#ref14">[14]</a></span>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Wheat</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Soya</li>
      <li>Fish</li>
      <li>Shellfish (including mussels, crab and shrimps)</li>
      <li>Peanuts</li>
      <li>Tree nuts </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other foods that may cause allergy are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Corn</li>
      <li>Oats</li>
      <li>Lentils</li>

      <li>Strawberries</li>
      <li>Tomato</li>
      <li>Pork</li>
      <li>Beef</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="snumber">2</span> <b class="sest">Bad Breath</b></p>
    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/side-effects/img/se02.jpg" width="240" height="206"></div>
    <p>There are specific foods that may cause bad breath. This is because they 
      contain volatile sulfur compounds - the culprit in causing bad breath. These 
      foods have odors which are picked up by the blood system and are exhaled 
      through the lungs up for several days after a meal:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Onions</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Cabbage</li>
      <li>Curry</li>
      <li>Alcohol</li>
      <li>Dairy foods (in lactose intolerant persons)</li>
      <li>Sugars</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="snumber">3</span> <b class="sest">Body Odor</b></p>
    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/side-effects/img/se18.jpg" width="240" height="164"></div>
    <p>According to research<span id="ref"><a href="#ref15">[15]</a></span>, red 
      meat and processed foods  have a negative impact on body odor 
      attractiveness.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">4</span> <b class="sest">Diarrhea</b></p>
    <p>Many people  experience diarrhea after  eating the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sorbitol containing foods - apple juice, pear juice, and some mixed 
        fruit drinks</li>
      <li>Unripe fruits</li>
      <li>Raw vegetables</li>
      <li>Dairy products</li>
      <li>Fatty foods</li>
      <li>Spinach</li>
      <li>Apricots</li>
      <li>Plums</li>
      <li>Sesame seed oils</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="snumber">5</span> <b class="sest">Constipation</b></p>
    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/side-effects/img/se10.jpg" width="240" height="164"></div>
    <p>The most common cause of constipation are lack of  fiber and a lot of animal fat. Constipation may be caused by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Meat - particularly beef, pork</li>
      <li>Refined grains - biscuits, macaroni, cookies, pastries, bread, 
        pasta, pretzels, rolls</li>
      <li>Starchy foods - potatoes, rice, corn, beans</li>
      <li>Dairy products - milk, cheese, ice cream<span id="ref"><a href="#ref16">[16]</a></span></li>
      <li>Prepackaged and fast   foods - hamburgers, fries, hotdogs, pizza, chips</li>
      <li>Products heavy in sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="snumber">6</span> <b class="sest">Gas, Flatulence, Abdominal 
      Bloating</b></p>
    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/side-effects/img/se06.jpg" width="240" height="224"></div>
    <p>Most foods that contain carbohydrates can cause gas. By contrast, fats 
      and proteins cause little gas. Foods that commonly cause gas are<span id="ref"><a href="#ref17">[17]</a></span>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Raffinose containing foods - beans, cabbage, brussels sprouts, broccoli, 
        asparagus, whole grains</li>
      <li>Lactose containing foods - milk, cheese, ice cream, bread, cereal, salad 
        dressing</li>
      <li>Fructose containing foods - onions, artichokes, pears, wheat</li>
      <li>Sorbitol containing foods - apples, pears, peaches, prunes</li>
      <li>Starches - potatoes, corn, noodles (Rice is the only starch that does 
        not cause gas)</li>
      <li>Foods high in fiber - oat bran, wheat bran</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="snumber">7</span> <b class="sest">Frequent Urination</b></p>
    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/side-effects/img/se11.jpg" width="240" height="169"></div>
    <p>Many foods high in vitamin C have natural diuretic properties and can lead 
      to frequent bathroom visits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Water-melon</li>
      <li>Melon</li>
      <li>Cranberry juice</li>
      <li>Cucumbers</li>
      <li>Asparagus</li>
      <li>Eggplant</li>
      <li>Anise</li>
      <li>Celery</li>
      <li>Lemon</li>
      <li>Cabbage</li>
      <li>Coffee (in moderate amounts)</li>
      <li>Tea</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="snumber">8</span> <b class="sest">Edema, Swelling, Water Retention</b></p>
    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/side-effects/img/se09.jpg" width="240" height="172"></div>
    <p>Foods high in salt, sodium or sugar may cause the body to retain considerable 
      fluids and worsen edema. The body needs a constant concentration of salt 
      in its tissues. When excess salt is taken in, the body dilutes it by retaining 
      fluid. Foods that commonly cause water retention are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Salty foods - olives, pickles, soy sauce, canned soups, bacon, sausages, 
        ham, salted nuts, processed meats, chips, pretzels, smoked fish</li>
      <li>Alcohol</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Chocolate</li>
      <li>Caffeine (too much of it)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="snumber">9</span> <b class="sest">Heartburn &amp; Acid Reflux</b></p>
    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/side-effects/img/se03.jpg" width="240" height="200"></div>
    <p>There is a relatively long list of foods that cause heartburn. Some foods 
      cause the lower esophageal sphincter - a muscle that helps to keep stomach 
      contents out of the esophagus - to become weaker, and some cause the stomach 
      to produce more acid than usual. Both of these problems can increase acid 
      reflux. Other foods can further irritate the lining of the esophagus after 
      it's been damaged by reflux. Most common food triggers for heartburn are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tomatoes</li>
      <li>Citrus fruits - lemons, grapefruits and oranges</li>
      <li>Chocolate</li>
      <li>Fried and fatty foods<span id="ref"><a href="#ref22">[22]</a></span> 
        - french-fries, potato chips, hash browns, fried clams, bacon, sausage, 
        hotdog</li>
      <li>Caffeine</li>
      <li>Alcohol</li>
      <li>Onions</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Mustard</li>
      <li>Vinegar</li>
      <li>Carbonated beverages (such as soda)</li>
      <li>Spicy foods - burritos, tacos, curry, homos, Cajun foods</li>
      <li>Nuts</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Peppermint and spear mint</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="snumber">10</span> <b class="sest">Stress</b></p>
    <div class="ifacts"> 
      <p><b id="stif">Interesting facts. Did you know?..</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>People who aren't overweight eat more fruit and fiber than overweight 
          people. Obese people are more likely than normal-weight people to injure 
          themselves</li>
        <li>Fast food is high in energy and 
          low in essential micronutrient density. Frequent fast food consumption 
          may contribute to weight gain<span id="ref"><a href="#ref10">[10]</a></span></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Certain foods and drinks act as powerful stimulants to the body and hence 
      are a direct cause of stress. These foods are called "pseudostressors" or 
      "sympathomimetics&quot;:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Caffeine containing foods (coffee, tea, colas and chocolates)</li>
      <li>Alcohol</li>
      <li>Refined sugar</li>
      <li>Wite flour</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Saturated fats</li>
      <li>Processed foods, such as junk foods and fast foods, 
        contain synthetic additives - preservatives, emulsifiers, thickeners, 
        stabilizers and flavor-enhancers</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="snumber">11</span> <b class="sest">Insomnia</b></p>
    <p>There are both foods that can help you fall asleep and the ones that  will 
      keep you awake. Sleepy foods  contain a chemical - an 
      amino acid - called tryptophan. And foods that can interfere with sleep 
      are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Caffeine containing - coffee, tea, cola, cocoa, chocolate</li>
      <li>Alcohol</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Fatty or spicy food</li>
      <li>Food additives (MSG, artificial colours, flavourings)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/side-effects/img/se13.jpg" width="240" height="186"></div>
    <p>High-carbohydrate, low-protein combination is thought to increase the availability 
      of tryptophan to the brain, which helps it make more melatonin and serotonin. 
      The following foods may produce sleep-inducing effect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dairy products: cottage cheese, cheese, milk</li>
      <li>Soy products: soy milk, tofu, soybean nuts</li>
      <li>Honey</li>

        day) prevents chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG)<span id="ref"><a href="#ref18">[18]</a></span></p>
    </div>
    <p>Although diet does not directly cause gastritis or peptic ulcers, it may 
      increase the risk of developing them and make them worse. Certain foods 
      may increase the stomach acids and irritate the stomach lining. Fast food 
      may aggravate gastritis. These contain sodium and calcium propionate, which, 
      over a period of time, can damage the stomach lining.</p>
    <p>Foods that often irritate the stomach lining are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spicy foods - black and red pepper, chilies, chili powder, and hot peppers</li>
      <li>Very acidic foods - coffee, lemon, pineapple, orange, tomato</li>

    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/side-effects/img/se21.jpg" width="240" height="183"></div>
    <p>High intake of saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol increases blood cholesterol levels, which, in turn, may increase the risk 
      of coronary heart disease.</p>
    <p>Saturated fats tend to raise both HDL (&quot;good&quot;) and 
      LDL (&quot;bad&quot;) cholesterol. </p>
    <p>Trans fats are  produced by heating liquid vegetable oils in the presence 
      of hydrogen.  Trans fats are even 
      worse for cholesterol levels than saturated fats because they raise LDL 
      and lower HDL cholesterol.</p>
    <p>Scientific studies have shown that there is a weak relationship between 
      the amount of cholesterol a person consumes and their blood cholesterol 
      levels. However, for some people, reducing the amount 
      of cholesterol in the diet has a small but helpful impact on blood  
      levels<span id="ref"><a href="#ref35">[35]</a></span>. And the American 
      Heart Association recommends that you limit your average daily cholesterol 
      intake to less than 300 milligrams. And if you have heart disease, the recommendation 
      is to limit your daily intake to less than 200 milligrams.</p>
    <p>Foods high in saturated fats:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fatty meats (beef, pork, lamb)</li>
      <li>Lard</li>
      <li>Skin and fat of poultry</li>

    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/side-effects/img/se19.jpg" width="240" height="190"></div>
    <p>In general, certain foods increase the risk for stones, but only in people 
      who have genetic or medical vulnerability. People whose diets are high in 
      animal protein and insufficient in fiber and fluids may be at higher risk for stones.</p>
    <p>A number of foods contain oxalic acid, but there is no proof that such 
      foods make any major contribution to calcium oxalate stones in people without 
      other risk factors. However, several studies have shown that increasing 
      dietary calcium and restricting salt, animal protein, and foods rich in 
      oxalate can help prevent calcium oxalate stones from returning<span id="ref"><a href="#ref26">[26]</a></span>.</p>

      <p><b><i>Interesting to know:</i></b> A high dietary calcium intake is strongly

    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/side-effects/img/se04.jpg" width="240" height="359"></div>
    <p>Foods may trigger not only migraine but also tension type headache attacks. 
      Studies that linked food with the migraines date back to the 1920's when 
      researchers began to examine and manipulate the diets of people suffering 
      from migraines. Certain foods often cause headache because of their high 
      content of the amino acids tyramine and phenyethyamine. The tyramine increases 
      blood flow to the brain which can lead to a headache. Other foods cause 
      headache in most vulnerable people because nitrites are added.</p>
    <p>&quot;Headache foods&quot; are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Beer<span id="ref"><a href="#ref20">[20]</a></span></li>

    <p>Gout, a kind of rheumatoid arthritis - a disease of the joints, gets aggravated 
      when sharp crystal shards of uric acid collect between joints and cause 
      painful inflammation. The body breaks down foods containing purines - an 
      organic substance - into uric acid, usually a neutral but unnecessary chemical 
      that is then filtered out of the bloodstream by the kidneys. Certain foods 
      contain such high levels of purines that can cause or aggravate gout.</p>
    <p>Research has shown that higher levels of meat and seafood consumption are 
      associated with an increased risk of gout, whereas a higher level of consumption 
      of low-fat dairy products is associated with a decreased risk. Moderate 
      intake of purine-rich vegetables or protein is not associated with an increased 
      risk of gout<span id="ref"><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></span>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fatty red meats (beef, lamb)</li>
      <li>Organ meat (kidney, heart, and liver)</li>

    <p>Eating too many foods high in beta-carotene, can cause a condition called 
      carotenemia. High levels of beta-carotene can cause a yellowish discoloration 
      of the skin, most noticeable on the palms and soles. Unlike jaundice, though, 
      carotenemia does not cause yellowing of the whites of the eyes. Foods containing 
      high amounts of beta-carotene are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Carrots</li>
      <li>Squash</li>
      <li>Sweet potatoes</li>
