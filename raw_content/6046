                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Last weekend we had a short trip to ƒ∞stanbul, the most famous city of Turkey. It is a kind of dream city for everyone in Turkey as it has a special effect on people with the odour of history blowing from its streets. There were a lot of wars in different periods of time in the cause of this glamorous city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is located on Bosphorus Strait and the city is divided into two sides of <span style="color: #333333;">Bosphorus</span>; The European and the Asian (Anatolia) sides. People pass from one side to another either on motorways (Bosphorus Bridge and Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge) or via sea transport. Sea transportation has a vital importance for poeple in ƒ∞stanbul as the city is surrounded by sea from all sides: the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sea of Marmara</span></strong>, the<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Golden Horn</span></strong>, the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bosphorus </span></strong>and the Black Sea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is one of the most important ancient cities around the world, so it witnessed several wars and periods of several empires. It was the capital city of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Roman Empire</span></strong> between the years of 330-395, of East Roman Empire (<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Byzantine Empire</span></strong>) between 395-1204 and 1261-1453, of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Latin Empire</span></strong> between 1204-1261, and finally it was the capital of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ottoman Empire</span></strong> between 1453-1922. Romans and Byzantines called it ‚ÄúConstantinople‚Äù and ‚ÄúByzantium‚Äù, Ottomans called it ‚ÄúDersaadet‚Äù, and <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Turkish Republic</span></strong> has been using ‚Äúƒ∞stanbul‚Äù as its name since 1930.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Istanbul has always been the flower of people throughout the history, so it has always attracted people and emigration to the city has always been in large numbers. With its so significant and strategic location as a joint between Asia and Europe, it has become one of the most attractive cosmopolitan city of the world. It shelters people from several ethnicities and religions, which can be obviously seen on buildings while walking around the city. To give an example, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ayasofya</span></strong> (Hagia Sophia), which was the biggest patriarchal cathedral of its period, was built by the Roman emperor Constantius in 360. This church was later converted into a mosque when it was conquered by Ottomans (by Sultan Mehmet II aka Mehmet the Conquerer). And it served as a mosque until 1935 when it was converted into a museum by Republic of Turkey.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The conquest of ƒ∞stanbul is known as the symbol of the end of Middle Age, so it has a worldwide significance. After the conquest in 1453, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Topkapƒ± Palace</span></strong> (Topkapƒ± Sarayƒ±) and <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Grand Bazaar</span></strong> (Kapalƒ± √áar≈üƒ±) were built. Then several new schools and Turkish baths were built and with the emigration of many people from all over the world besides the poeple of the country, it became a city of Muslim, Jewish and Christian people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After an enjoyable train travel, the magnificient train station, Haydar Pa≈üa (<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Haydarpasha_train_station_istanbul.jpg" target="_blank"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Haydarpasha train station)</span></strong></a> welcomed us with its majestic architecture.¬† Its roots go back to the year 1872 and it¬† locates at the Anatolian side of ƒ∞stanbul. By the time we got off the train, we felt the exciting smell of the sea without seeing the sea itself. Our hotel was at the European side of the city, so we had a short travel on a ferry boat to pass to the other side. I must say that all of our senses became so active during this travel as we had the chance of watching this mega city from the middle. We became more and more excited by the blow from the sea licking our faces.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/fishonboat.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-777" title="fishonboat" src="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/fishonboat.jpg" alt="fishonboat Istanbul" width="350" height="221" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we arrived the European side, we felt another impressive smell coming from some special boats on the sea. These boats are known as floating restaurants serving grilled fish in half bread with some greens and onion. This is my favorite fast food in ƒ∞stanbul. As it was still morning, we decided to eat at one of these restaurants later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After some rest at our hotel, I had a meeting with some colleagues. I must admit that I was looking forward to finishing the meeting because I would go deep into the city with my husband in the afternoon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/tram.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-778" title="tram" src="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/tram.jpg" alt="tram Istanbul" width="350" height="388" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the meeting, we went out from the hotel and started to discover the city. Our first destination was the most famous square of the city, Taksim. On our way to Taksim, we saw a historic tram along ƒ∞stiklal Avenue, which serves between Taksim and T√ºnel. This tram completes the historic view of the city with its old fashioned appearance and its nostalgic sound.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/church2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-787" title="church2" src="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/church2.jpg" alt="church2 Istanbul" width="350" height="263" /></a></p>
<p>We walked around the historical narrow streets of this avenue and we came accross Saint Anthony Catholic church on ƒ∞stiklal Avenue. There were a lot of tourists visiting this church, which has a fascinating architecture.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/flowerpassage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-779" title="flowerpassage" src="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/flowerpassage.jpg" alt="flowerpassage Istanbul" width="350" height="263" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then we went on our tour on the same avenue and we saw another famous building, the historic Flowers Passageway (<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">√ái√ßek Pasajƒ±</span></strong>). The history of this passageway goes back to 1800s. The original name of it was Cit√© de P√©ra and it was originally a passage for various shops and upscale flats. After several years it became a passage for flower shop and it got its name as Flowers Passageway. After years, drinking houses (meyhane) replaced flower shops and today, flower is just seen in its name and in the vases on dinner tables. The passage has become one of the most preferable entertaining places with drinking houses in it. While you‚Äôre having your dinner and drinking your beer or raki, musicians often come and walk among tables playing clarinet, accordion, tabor or violin. So it becomes an unforgettable evening for you. You are often supposed to tip these musicians.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/calamari.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-780" title="calamari" src="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/calamari.jpg" alt="calamari Istanbul" width="350" height="263" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had our dinner at one of these drinking houses. We generally have raki with fish, but this time we craved for cold beer as it was too hot on that day. As an appetizer, fried calamari is always our first preference, and it wasn‚Äôt different this time. We adore fried calamari, but it‚Äôs hard to find fresh calamari in Eski≈üehir. And we were aware that Istanbul was just the place of fresh calamari.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/calamari1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-781 aligncenter" title="calamari1" src="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/calamari1.jpg" alt="calamari1 Istanbul" width="250" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was served with a usual sauce of yogurt and garlic. We finished all at once. We were so happy to dip our calamari into this sauce and eat it without waiting more and to have a swig of cold beer just after it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pilchard.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-782" title="pilchard" src="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pilchard.jpg" alt="pilchard Istanbul" width="350" height="263" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While having that marvelous fried calamari, we ordered two portions fried pilchard, which was special for that restaurant. It was served with lemon slices, sliced onion and fresh arugula. When I had a small piece, I felt in heaven and it could have been impossible to stop eating all of them at once if my husband hadn‚Äôt reminded me of the pleasure of eating.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/salad.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-783" title="salad" src="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/salad.jpg" alt="salad Istanbul" width="350" height="263" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was another must for us to order a season salad to accompany the fish. With our fried pilchards, a fresh season salad came and we made its dressing on the table with lemon juice, natural olive oil and vinegar. They went together very well. We left there with happy stomachs. I can still feel their tastes in my mouth.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/istanbul.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-784" title="istanbul" src="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/istanbul.jpg" alt="istanbul Istanbul" width="350" height="263" /></a></p>
<p>The following day, after our meeting for work, we passed to Anatolian side to meet some friends. We hadn‚Äôt seen each other for months, so we were so excited to see them. It was a wonderful day, so we decided to walk on the coast for a while to feel its pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/drink.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785" title="drink" src="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/drink.jpg" alt="drink Istanbul" width="350" height="263" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our friends, then, took us to a club house and I had this yummy drink there. At first, I didn‚Äôt want to order it. But my friend insisted me on tasting it. It was scrumptious! The main ingredient was milk, so I didn‚Äôt think it was worth tasting, but I was wrong. The mixture of milk, ginger, cinnamon, sugar, black tea and ice made it incredible.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sunset.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786" title="sunset" src="http://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/sunset.jpg" alt="sunset Istanbul" width="350" height="263" /></a></p>
<p>And as everything beautiful has an end, the day was very close to the end, so we went out to watch the fascinating sunset.</p>

                        <p>Her love of cooking started as a little child by messing her mom's dishes up! Despite all her mom's effort to teach her how to cook, she was happy as an 'assistant'. What made her want to jump to an upper level was her dad's compliments for the first dish she made herself. Finally, her husband, who claims that ancient humans were stronger than we are today as their main food source was meat, helped her love cooking meat dishes and improving vegetable dishes to make them more edible for him!</p>

            <p>Is pilchard a type of fish?  Fried calamari is a favorite of mine and we enjoy it with a marinara (tomato)sauce, either spicy hot, medium, or mild in taste.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing your lovely trip to Istanbul.  I think<br />
I need to put Turkey on my list of countries I want to visit someday!  It looks and sounds *absolutely lovely*.</p>
<p>Ah, Raki!  Looking forward to learning more about it whenever you get to it as well.  Since I&#8217;m not sure exactly what that is, is it something you can make at home?</p>

I nearly went last year, but my hubby wanted to come, and he could not travel, so its moving to the top of my list.  What wonderful details and story   &#8211; I learned a lot&#8230;of course =)</p>

            <p>Gera- Your grandparents were from Turkey? So you must have heard a lot about Istanbul. You should come visit here to live in those stories you heard.</p>
<p>Lauren- The city is so beautiful not only with its view, but also the social life it has.</p>
<p>Jen- Thank you.</p>
<p>Leesie- Pilchard is a kind of small fish and it is served either fried or grilled(if it is big enough). It has an outstanding taste.<br />
I can say that you will fall in love with Istanbul if you have a chance of visiting one day.<br />
And I&#8217;m planning to write about Turkish raki in details soon. Oh, we cannot make it at home.It is both difficult and dangerous. It may damage your body. Buying it from a market is always better.</p>
<p>Jenn- Thank you. It was so enjoyable for me to take these photos. </p>
<p>Sophie- I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t regret if you visit here.</p>
<p>Oyster- You shouldn&#8217;t delay it more, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll find a lot to do in Istanbul.</p>
<p>Natasha- I wish I had the ability to draw or paint this sunset, it was so impressive.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the history behind this beautiful city! You really captured one of the most appealing aspects of Istanbul when you described it as a kind of gateway between Europe and Asia. It seems to embody the best of both of these worlds. Your photos are lovely &#8211; I&#8217;d love to visit and see the sights for myself. But now, I am quite hungry for some calamari! It sounds like it was a wonderful day spent with your husband and some good friends.</p>

            <p>Zerrin,what a beautifully written post and such great pictures. I am glad you had a good time in Istanbul, it is a dream city, you are right. First time I was there was 9 years ago (so glad I get to there too every time I go to Azerbaijan) and I stayed at my uncles&#8217; for 2 weeks. Simply fell in love with the city, it is so busy, so lively, you just want to live and live:)</p>

<p>Hey by the way, I finished getting your things together this weekend.  I am hoping you will like everything. Joel will get them in the mail on Monday. Not quite sure how long it will take to get to you&#8230;.!!</p>
