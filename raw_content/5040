              the technical name for the brand names NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, 
              and Equal-Measure. It was discovered by accident in 1965 when James 
              Schlatter, a chemist of G.D. Searle Company, was testing an anti-ulcer 
              drug.</font></p>
            <p> <font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Aspartame 
              was approved for dry goods in 1981 and for carbonated beverages 
              in 1983. It was originally approved for dry goods on July 26, 1974, 
              but objections filed by neuroscience researcher Dr John W. Olney 
              and Consumer attorney James Turner in August 1974 as well as investigations 
              of G.D. Searle's research practices caused the U.S. Food and Drug 
              Administration (FDA) to put approval of aspartame on hold (December 
              5, 1974). In 1985, Monsanto purchased G.D. Searle and made Searle 
              Pharmaceuticals and The NutraSweet Company separate subsidiaries.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Aspartame accounts 
              for over 75 percent of the adverse reactions to food additives reported 
              to the FDA. Many of these reactions are very serious including seizures 
              and death.(1) A few of the 90 different documented symptoms listed 
              in the report as being caused by aspartame include: Headaches/migraines, 
              dizziness, seizures, nausea, numbness, muscle spasms, weight gain, 
              rashes, depression, fatigue, irritability, tachycardia, insomnia, 
              vision problems, hearing loss, heart palpitations, breathing difficulties, 
              anxiety attacks, slurred speech, loss of taste, tinnitus, vertigo, 
              memory loss, and joint pain.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">According to 
              researchers and physicians studying the <a href="http://www.mercola.com/article/aspartame/hidden_dangers.htm">adverse 
              effects of aspartame</a>, the following chronic illnesses can be 
              triggered or worsened by ingesting of aspartame:(2) Brain tumors, 
              multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, chronic fatigue syndrome, Parkinson's 
              disease, Alzheimer's, mental retardation, lymphoma, birth defects, 
              fibromyalgia, and diabetes.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Aspartame is 
              made up of three chemicals: aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol. 
              The book &quot;Prescription for Nutritional Healing,&quot; by James 
              and Phyllis Balch, lists aspartame under the category of &quot;chemical 
              poison.&quot; As you shall see, that is exactly what it is.</font></p>

            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dr. Russell 
              L. Blaylock, a professor of neurosurgery at the Medical University 
              of Mississippi, recently published a book thoroughly detailing the 
              damage that is caused by the ingestion of excessive aspartic acid 
              from aspartame. Blaylock makes use of almost 500 scientific references 
              to show how excess free excitatory amino acids such as aspartic 
              acid and glutamic acid (about 99 percent of monosodium glutamate 
              (MSG) is glutamic acid) in our food supply are causing serious chronic 
              neurological disorders and a myriad of other acute symptoms.(3)</font></p>

              (and Glutamate) Cause Damage</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Aspartate and 
              glutamate act as neurotransmitters in the brain by facilitating 
              the transmission of information from neuron to neuron. Too much 
              aspartate or glutamate in the brain kills certain neurons by allowing 
              the influx of too much calcium into the cells. This influx triggers 
              excessive amounts of free radicals, which kill the cells. The neural 
              cell damage that can be caused by excessive aspartate and glutamate 
              is why they are referred to as &quot;excitotoxins.&quot; They &quot;excite&quot; 
              or stimulate the neural cells to death.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Aspartic acid 
              is an amino acid. Taken in its free form (unbound to proteins) it 
              significantly raises the blood plasma level of aspartate and glutamate. 
              The excess aspartate and glutamate in the blood plasma shortly after 
              ingesting aspartame or products with free glutamic acid (glutamate 
              precursor) leads to a high level of those neurotransmitters in certain 
              areas of the brain.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The blood brain 
              barrier (BBB), which normally protects the brain from excess glutamate 
              and aspartate as well as toxins, 1) is not fully developed during 
              childhood, 2) does not fully protect all areas of the brain, 3) 
              is damaged by numerous chronic and acute conditions, and 4) allows 
              seepage of excess glutamate and aspartate into the brain even when 
              intact.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The excess 
              glutamate and aspartate slowly begin to destroy neurons. The large 
              majority (75 percent or more) of neural cells in a particular area 
              of the brain are killed before any clinical symptoms of a chronic 
              illness are noticed. A few of the many chronic illnesses that have 
              been shown to be contributed to by long-term exposure to excitatory 
              amino acid damage include:</font></p>

              of potential endocrine responses, i.e., elevated cortisol and prolactin, 
              and differential responses between males and females, would also 
              suggest a neuroendocrine link and that supplemental L-glutamic acid 
              should be avoided by women of childbearing age and individuals with 
              affective disorders.&quot;(4)</font></p>

              complaint of persons suffering from the effect of aspartame is memory 
              loss. Ironically, in 1987, G.D. Searle, the manufacturer of aspartame, 
              undertook a search for a drug to combat memory loss caused by excitatory 
              amino acid damage. Blaylock is one of many scientists and physicians 
              who are concerned about excitatory amino acid damage caused by ingestion 
              of aspartame and MSG.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A few of the 
              many experts who have spoken out against the damage being caused 
              by aspartate and glutamate include Adrienne Samuels, Ph.D., an experimental 
              psychologist specializing in research design. Another is Olney, 
              a professor in the department of psychiatry, School of Medicine, 
              Washington University, a neuroscientist and researcher, and one 
              of the world's foremost authorities on excitotoxins. (He informed 
              Searle in 1971 that aspartic acid caused holes in the brains of 
              mice.)</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Phenylalanine 
              (50 percent of aspartame)</b><br>
              <br>
              Phenylalanine is an amino acid normally found in the brain. Persons 
              with the genetic disorder phenylketonuria (PKU) cannot metabolize 
              phenylalanine. This leads to dangerously high levels of phenylalanine 
              in the brain (sometimes lethal). It has been shown that ingesting 
              aspartame, especially along with carbohydrates, can lead to excess 
              levels of phenylalanine in the brain even in persons who do not 
              have PKU.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is not 
              just a theory, as many people who have eaten large amounts of aspartame 
              over a long period of time and do not have PKU have been shown to 
              have excessive levels of phenylalanine in the blood. Excessive levels 
              of phenylalanine in the brain can cause the levels of seratonin 
              in the brain to decrease, leading to emotional disorders such as 
              depression. It was shown in human testing that phenylalanine levels 
              of the blood were increased significantly in human subjects who 
              chronically used aspartame.(6)</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even a single 
              use of aspartame raised the blood phenylalanine levels. In his testimony 
              before the U.S. Congress, Dr. Louis J. Elsas showed that high blood 
              phenylalanine can be concentrated in parts of the brain and is especially 
              dangerous for infants and fetuses. He also showed that phenylalanine 
              is metabolised much more efficiently by rodents than by humans.(7)</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One account 
              of a case of extremely high phenylalanine levels caused by aspartame 
              was recently published in the <i>Wednesday Journal</i> in an article 
              titled &quot;An Aspartame Nightmare.&quot; John Cook began drinking 
              six to eight diet drinks every day. His symptoms started out as 
              memory loss and frequent headaches. He began to crave more aspartame-sweetened 
              drinks. His condition deteriorated so much that he experienced wide 
              mood swings and violent rages. Even though he did not suffer from 
              PKU, a blood test revealed a phenylalanine level of 80 mg/dl. He 
              also showed abnormal brain function and brain damage. After he kicked 
              his aspartame habit, his symptoms improved dramatically.(8)</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As Blaylock 
              points out in his book, early studies measuring phenylalanine buildup 
              in the brain were flawed. Investigators who measured specific brain 
              regions and not the average throughout the brain notice significant 
              rises in phenylalanine levels. Specifically the hypothalamus, medulla 
              oblongata, and corpus striatum areas of the brain had the largest 
              increases in phenylalanine. Blaylock goes on to point out that excessive 
              buildup of phenylalanine in the brain can cause schizophrenia or 
              make one more susceptible to seizures.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Therefore, 
              long-term, excessive use of aspartame may provide a boost to sales 
              of seratonin reuptake inhibitors such as Prozac and drugs to control 
              schizophrenia and seizures.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Methanol 
              (aka wood alcohol/poison) (10 percent of aspartame)</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Methanol/wood 
              alcohol is a deadly poison. Some people may remember methanol as 
              the poison that has caused some &quot;skid row&quot; alcoholics 
              to end up blind or dead. Methanol is gradually released in the small 
              intestine when the methyl group of aspartame encounter the enzyme 
              chymotrypsin.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The absorption 
              of methanol into the body is sped up considerably when free methanol 
              is ingested. Free methanol is created from aspartame when it is 
              heated to above 86 Fahrenheit (30 Centigrade). This would occur 
              when aspartame-containing product is improperly stored or when it 
              is heated (e.g., as part of a &quot;food&quot; product such as Jello).</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Methanol breaks 
              down into formic acid and formaldehyde in the body. Formaldehyde 
              is a deadly neurotoxin. An EPA assessment of methanol states that 
              methanol &quot;is considered a cumulative poison due to the low 
              rate of excretion once it is absorbed. In the body, methanol is 
              oxidized to formaldehyde and formic acid; both of these metabolites 
              are toxic.&quot; They recommend a limit of consumption of 7.8 mg/day. 
              A one-liter (approx. 1 quart) aspartame-sweetened beverage contains 
              about 56 mg of methanol. Heavy users of aspartame-containing products 
              consume as much as 250 mg of methanol daily or 32 times the EPA 
              limit.(9)</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Symptoms from 
              methanol poisoning include headaches, ear buzzing, dizziness, nausea, 
              gastrointestinal disturbances, weakness, vertigo, chills, memory 
              lapses, numbness and shooting pains in the extremities, behavioral 
              disturbances, and neuritis. The most well known problems from methanol 
              poisoning are vision problems including misty vision, progressive 
              contraction of visual fields, blurring of vision, obscuration of 
              vision, retinal damage, and blindness. Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen, 
              causes retinal damage, interferes with DNA replication and causes 
              birth defects.(10)</font></p>

            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Due to the 
              lack of a couple of key enzymes, humans are many times more sensitive 
              to the toxic effects of methanol than animals. Therefore, tests 
              of aspartame or methanol on animals do not accurately reflect the 
              danger for humans. As pointed out by Dr. Woodrow C. Monte, director 
              of the food science and nutrition laboratory at Arizona State University, 
              &quot;There are no human or mammalian studies to evaluate the possible 
              mutagenic, teratogenic or carcinogenic effects of chronic administration 
              of methyl alcohol.&quot;(11)</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">He was so concerned 
              about the unresolved safety issues that he filed suit with the FDA 
              requesting a hearing to address these issues. He asked the FDA to 
              &quot;slow down on this soft drink issue long enough to answer some 
              of the important questions. It's not fair that you are leaving the 
              full burden of proof on the few of us who are concerned and have 
              such limited resources. You must remember that you are the American 
              public's last defense. Once you allow usage (of aspartame) there 
              is literally nothing I or my colleagues can do to reverse the course. 
              Aspartame will then join saccharin, the sulfiting agents, and God 
              knows how many other questionable compounds enjoined to insult the 
              human constitution with governmental approval.&quot;(10) Shortly 
              thereafter, the Commissioner of the FDA, Arthur Hull Hayes, Jr., 
              approved the use of aspartame in carbonated beverages, he then left 
              for a position with G.D. Searle's public relations firm.(11)</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It has been 
              pointed out that some fruit juices and alcoholic beverages contain 
              small amounts of methanol. It is important to remember, however, 
              that methanol never appears alone. In every case, ethanol is present, 
              usually in much higher amounts. Ethanol is an antidote for methanol 
              toxicity in humans.(9) The troops of Desert Storm were &quot;treated&quot; 
              to large amounts of aspartame-sweetened beverages, which had been 
              heated to over 86 degrees F in the Saudi Arabian sun. Many of them 
              returned home with numerous disorders similar to what has been seen 
              in persons who have been chemically poisoned by formaldehyde. The 
              free methanol in the beverages may have been a contributing factor 
              in these illnesses. Other breakdown products of aspartame such as 
              DKP (discussed below) may also have been a factor.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In a 1993 act 
              that can only be described as &quot;unconscionable,&quot; the FDA 
              approved aspartame as an ingredient in numerous food items that 
              would always be heated to above 86 degree F (30 degree C).</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Diketopiperazine 
              (DKP)</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">DKP is a byproduct 
              of aspartame metabolism. DKP has been implicated in the occurrence 
              of brain tumors. Olney noticed that DKP, when nitrosated in the 
              gut, produced a compound that was similar to N-nitrosourea, a powerful 
              brain tumor causing chemical. Some authors have said that DKP is 
              produced after aspartame ingestion. I am not sure if that is correct. 
              It is definitely true that DKP is formed in liquid aspartame-containing 
              products during prolonged storage.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">G.D. Searle 
              conducted animal experiments on the safety of DKP. The FDA found 
              numerous experimental errors occurred, including &quot;clerical 
              errors, mixed-up animals, animals not getting drugs they were supposed 
              to get, pathological specimens lost because of improper handling,&quot; 
              and many other errors.(12) These sloppy laboratory procedures may 
              explain why both the test and control animals had sixteen times 
              more brain tumors than would be expected in experiments of this 
              length.</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In an ironic 
              twist, shortly after these experimental errors were discovered, 
              the FDA used guidelines recommended by G.D. Searle to develop the 
              industry-wide FDA standards for good laboratory practices.(11)</font></p>
            <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">DKP has also 
              been implicated as a cause of uterine polyps and changes in blood 
              cholesterol by FDA Toxicologist Dr. Jacqueline Verrett in her testimony 
              before the U.S. Senate.(13)</font></p>
