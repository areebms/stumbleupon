    <h1>Habits That Make You Obese and Overweight</h1>
  <div id="lcol"> 
    <p><span class="snumber">1</span> <b class="sest">TV Watching</b></p>
    <p>Prolonged TV watching is a strong predictor for obesity<span id="ref"><a href="#ref1">1</a></span>. 
      Recent research<span id="ref"><a href="#ref2">2</a></span> has proved that 
      people who watch around two hours of TV per day are much more likely to 
      be overweight than those who watched only half an hour per day. When you 
      watch TV you are virtually motionless. Your heart rate, blood pressure 
      and metabolic rate decline, resulting in burning 20 to 30 calories less 
      per hour. Research by Harvard University<span id="ref"><a href="#ref4">4</a></span> 
      has shown that there is a link between the amount children eat and the amount 
      of television they watch.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">2</span> <b class="sest">Eating Too Fast</b></p>
    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/obesity-img/stopwatch.jpg" width="200" height="168"></div>
    <p>It is a habit of most people living in a fast paced society. Eating fast 
      lets you eat too much before you are fully aware of it. It takes the brain 
      about 15-20 minutes to start signaling feelings of fullness. Scientists 
      suppose that fast eating is a risk factor for the metabolic syndrome<span id="ref"><a href="#ref3">3</a></span>, 
      a combination of the symptoms such as high blood pressure, obesity,  and insulin resistance.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">3</span> <b class="sest">Task Snacking</b></p>
    <p>Task snacking refers to eating while doing other activities. If you often 
      eat  snacks while working by yourself in front of your computer, 
      while driving, watching TV, or standing at the kitchen counter, shopping 
      with a friend, or talking on the phone, it's likely that the "task snacking" 
      eating style is increasing your odds of becoming overweight or obese.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">4</span> <b class="sest">Passion for Fast Food</b></p>
    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/obesity-img/fastfood.jpg" width="200" height="149"></div>
    <p>One of the big reasons we're seeing more obesity in 
      our society these days is that we are too stressed and busy to make 
      healthy dinners at home, often opting to get fast food at the nearest drive-thru 
      instead. Fast foods compromise the quality of the meal by replacing more 
      healthy choices. They are  known for having a high content of saturated 
      and trans-fat, lack of fiber, and massive portion sizes, which leads to 
      obesity.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">5</span> <b class="sest">Eating To Manage Feelings</b></p>
    <p>Emotional eating is the practice of consuming large quantities of food 
      (usually "comfort" or &quot;junk&quot;) in response to feelings (such as depression, 
      anxiety, or loneliness) instead of hunger.</p>
    <p>Experts estimate that 75% of overeating is caused by emotions. How many 
      times have you found yourself scouring the kitchen for a snack, or absently 
      munching on junk food when you're stressed, but not really hungry?</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">6</span> <b class="sest">Too Busy To Exercise</b></p>
    <p>With all the demands on your schedule, exercise may be one of the last 
      things on your to-do list. If so, you're not alone. Americans live a more 
      sedentary lifestyle than we have in past generations, yet our minds seem 
      to be racing from everything we have to do. Unfortunately, from sitting 
      in traffic, clocking hours at our desks, and plopping in front of the TV 
      in exhaustion at the end of the day, exercise often goes by the wayside.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">7</span> <b class="sest">Your Friends Can Make You 
      Obese</b></p>
    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/obesity-img/friends.jpg" width="200" height="151"></div>
    <p>If you're putting on weight, you might want to take a look at who you're 
      hanging around with. A study<span id="ref"><a href="#ref7">7</a></span> 
      published in the July 26, 2007 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine 
      suggests that obesity may be "socially contagious." The study was
      conducted on more than 12,000 people over 32 years, and concluded that having 
      an overweight friend, sibling or spouse increased one's risk of obesity 
      by 37 to 57 percent.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">8</span> <b class="sest">Lack Of Sleep</b></p>
    <p>Sleep deprivation can increase your risk of obesity by boosting ghrelin 
      (an appetite stimulating hormone) and lowering leptin (an appetite suppressor). 
      The study<span id="ref"><a href="#ref5">5</a></span> from the University 
      of Bristol in the United Kingdom found that, compared to an eight 
      hours of shut-eye, each one-hour decrease in sleep duration was linked to 
      almost 3% more body fat.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">9</span> <b class="sest">Unaware Of Calories</b></p>
    <p>Many people eat with no idea of the calorie or fat value. This leads 
      to weight gain because you can easily consume 
      twice the normal amount required to maintain your weight, let alone lose 
      weight, if you don't know how many calories you are consuming.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">10</span> <b class="sest">Credit Cards</b></p>
    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/obesity-img/credit-card.jpg" width="200" height="150"></div>
    <p>Your plastic may be affecting more than just your credit score. Visa conducted 
      a study of 100,000 fast-food restaurant transactions and found that people 
      who pay for their food with a credit card spend 30% more than those who 
      pay with cash. For the average woman, who visits a fast-food restaurant 
      once a week, that adds an extra  4.9 pounds per year.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">11</span> <b class="sest">Missing Meals</b></p>
    <p>Research shows that people who eat breakfast are less likely to be overweight, 
      and that morning meals seem to help those who've lost weight keep it off. 
      Denise Bruner, MD, obesity specialist and former president of the American 
      Society of Bariatric Physicians, says that skipping meals of any kind results 
      in a "tremendous bout of compensatory hunger."</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">12</span> <b class="sest">Uncomfortable Clothing</b></p>
    <p>Researchers from the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse<span id="ref"><a href="#ref6">6</a></span> 
      found that casual and comfortable clothing workdays promote increased physical 
      activity. Specifically, study participants took an average of 491 (or 8%) 
      more steps on Jeans Day than on those days in which they wore normal business 
      attire. It is also estimated that study participants burned an average of 
      25 additional calories on Jeans Day with the extra steps and miles walked. 
      Wearing casual clothing every day for 50 weeks of work translates into burning 
      an additional  6,250 calories per year.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">13</span> <b class="sest">Neglecting Scales</b></p>
    <div class="seimg"><img src="/food/obesity-img/scales.jpg" width="200" height="206"></div>
    <p>Recent study from the University of Minnesota found that people  who weighed 
      themselves daily lost about 12 pounds over two years, while those who never 
      did shed only four pounds. Other research, published in The New England 
      Journal of Medicine, concluded that those who have daily weigh-ins (along 
      with face-to-face support) are 82% less likely to regain five pounds than 
      a control group without weigh-ins or support. </p>
    <p><span class="snumber">14</span> <b class="sest">Boredom</b></p>
    <p>A survey by the Priory Group in the U.K. found that more people ate when 
      bored than when stressed.</p>
